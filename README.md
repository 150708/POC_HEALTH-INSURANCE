Title: Predicting Health Insurance Premiums Using Supervised Machine Learning

Description:
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict recommended insurance types and premiums for health insurance customers based on demographic data and insurance history.

Data Processing:

Conducted data preprocessing by dropping irrelevant columns and applying label encoding on categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets and standardized features for model optimization.
Modeling:

Built and trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression models to predict insurance recommendations.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
Visualization:

Explored data through visualizations like correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, box plots, pair plots, and scatter plots.
Insights:

Identified significant patterns in customer age and premium distribution, as well as relationships between insurance type and premium pricing. The models provided key insights into the factors influencing policy recommendations.
